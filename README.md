# Uniandes - IIND2104 Probabilistic models, final project.

Here is a visualization tools build on R, using markovchain, plotly, shinyApp and  other visualization packages. The main idea was to build a model that helps the health department of the goverment to make better decisions about the resources and priority of different scenarios under the terms given by the requirements report build for teachers of the subject.

The different scenarios were modeled as decision markovian processes, using both discret and continuous markov chains to apply, steady state and transient analysis to the models. Conclusions could be made under theorical results. 

At the final stage of the project the task was to find the optimal decision process that should take a person with cancer given an initial state and the age of the patient. This was done using the model of a MDP (Markovian Decision Process) apply to the theory of the optimal principle and the bellman equations concepts.

Take into account:
  - All the information material of the different stages, the comments of the code and the app is in spanish.
  - All the requirements report could be found on the ./reqs directory

# How to run it?
